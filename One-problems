1. join() segfaults -- function header
	When we run join, we do not get the expected behavior. We believe that this is because of the function header, and in class, Bill mentioned that we'll need a double pointer to our thread struct. what does this mean?
2. malloc() did not allocate memory
	When we first called my_pthread_create(), we would try to allocate some memory (~line 73). We would not get any memory back, and the program would segfault. Any reason for this?
3. mutex locks
4. yield()
5. maintenance cycle
6. Mutex announcement code


What is the best way to approach the next project? 
What is the best way to desing the abstraction of the page?
Pages would be swapped in and out of the 8MB memory, right? So when we malloc, we are mallocing inside a specific page first, then going to a new page if the first page is full?
